# Collooney Physiotherapy Website - PP1<!-- omit from toc -->

This project is a website for a physiotherapy clinic based in Collooney, Sligo.

They provide a quality service and pride themselves in being industry leaders. They therefore want a professional website that suits their branding and their ethos. Since they are located in a region with lower population density, they want somewhere that people can discover not only information about their services, but also connect with them through social media, thereby increasing their potential client pool.

## Design & Development

### 5 Planes of UX
#### Strategy
- Users in the geographical are  need a physiotherapist but don't know where to find one. The clinic itself wants to get more clients to increase business.
  
#### Scope
- Include a homepage wtogive an overall impresiosn onf the page. Includsome of the treatments available ad have a way that thae users can make a booking, o enquire about a booing.
  
#### Structure
- 3 pages: Home, Treatments and Bookings. Users can easilyad cleal navigate between these fro a navbar (or dropdown menu on mobile deviees)
  
#### Skeleton
- A hero image greets the user when they first link to the site. A clear navbar at the top links to the 3 pages, whilst making clear which page the user is on. The pages contain a mixture of text and complementary images to give users visual guidance to what they can expect if they choose to become a client.
  
See [Wireframes](#wireframes) below.

#### Surface
- A soft, professional pastel [colour scheme](#colour-scheme) to represent calmness and professionalism. Intuitive UI with clear links, explanatory text and all basic information.

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme changed after the deployment due to [accessibility issues](#issuesbugs). The intial colour scheme included light pastel tones to give the user a feeling of calmness and professionalism; a clean experience without being cold and unwelcoming.

However, whilst testing using [WAVE](#technology--resources), it revealed a low contrast between the header background colour and the font colour. After experimenting with different font colours, it became apparent that the best option was to choose a darker text colour. For this reason, I settled on the following colour scheme.

Although this wasn't the original plan, it still looks and feels clean, professional and warm, thereby fulfilling the orininal criteria.

- **Languages :** HTML and CSS, with Markdown being used for this readme.
- **Template :** The [CodeInstitute template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template) was used in order to install all the relevant tools for the code to function.
- [**Github**](https://github.com/) was used to host the project. I used `git commit` regularly to create versions of the project at regular intervals. This meant that I could be more precise if I needed to `git reset`.
- [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes for mobile, table and desktop.
- [**Pexels**](https://www.pexels.com/) was used to find royalty-free images that I could safely use without worry of copyright infringement.
- [**Markdown Guide**](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) was used to help create the readme.
- [**Contrast Finder**](https://app.contrast-finder.org/) and [**Coolors**](https://coolors.co/) were used to help find a colour scheme with an acceptable contrast.
- [**Favicon.io**](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) was used to create a custom favicon.
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) and [Lighthouse](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk) testing tools were used to locate minor issues and check both accessbility and performance.
